                                <p>I worked here as a bartender where I experienced what it is like to work as a night shift bartender 
                                    and adjust to how physically demanding it can be to serve customers as fast as possible while being

                                <p>Here I worked as a kitchen assistant, where I helped the head chef with incoming orders by ensuring 
                                    that the work areas were clean, preparing and cutting ingredients, prioritizing side dishes, picking 
                                    up and starting with new orders, or standing in when the head chef was unavailable.

                                    Here I was trained and tasked to market products to customers and capture their details into the system 
                                    if they were purchasing a policy, I trained more than I was able to work, but at the end of the day I didn’t 
                                    meet the qualifying pre-requisites and I wasn’t able to land the job, but where I lost a career opportunity, 
                                    I got a wonderful opportunity to learn some communication skills.
